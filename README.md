# Dinner-Time

## Purpose
With many Americans dealing with a busy schedule, they sometimes find a hard time to find a meal to eat and drink for dinner. With that in mind, this website takes the hassle out of finding a dinner to make. The dinner will be randomly generated upon request. If the user does not like their selection they are able to keep trying until the user finds somthing they want to have for dinner. If the user is satisfied with the dinner they can either save that corresponding meal and/ or drink. Therer will be a designated area where the user can return to find thier saved meal and drink.
